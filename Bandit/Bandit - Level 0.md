**Bandit Level 0**

Challenge :

*The goal of this level is for you to log into the game using SSH. The host to which you need to connect is bandit.labs.overthewire.org, on port 2220. The username is bandit0 and the password is bandit0. Once logged in, go to the Level 1 page to find out how to beat Level 1.
Commands you may need to solve this level : ssh*

In order to connect to someone using SSH you need to follow the typo that goes like this : `ssh username@IP_ADRESS_OR_DOMAIN_NAME -p NUMBER`

`-p` is used to specify the port you want to connect to. It's trying to connect to port 22 by default if not specified.

In this case, based off the information we have, we do like this :

They ask for a password, that we know about so write it down and it if it got successful you should have this :
